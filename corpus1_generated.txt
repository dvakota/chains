 Funny? Oh Kate, seated opposite next to me, I am fully aware of its nature and undertake to abide by its conditions without exception. 1 1 ( The Safe- word (s) ). Two can play nice and behave myself.

 What do you mean that you care for me, his unfathomable gray eyes of the Dominant without his love. I just hope neither of us. We live in. Mrs. Paedo? I whisper. I'm shaky and very slowly inserts the objects, one of the Dominant, The color suits you and your smart mouth, giving due regard to my mortification, you're a keen fisherman. Ray is in hand- such a beautiful girl, he says. I'm trying to hide, just as a weapon. Fuck! My subconscious sneers at me. Talk to me, by the entryway, is that why there have been found sobbing alone in the area.

 The Red Room of Pain again. Ana will call back with equal fervor, my breathing... twine.. swallowing semen. Well, that reminds me. Now, I'm not a great deal of time anyway. What for? Yes... could I have a mind to run my tongue skims my lower lip and pulls a condom on to it. But if he's struggling with the shopping bag on a sidelight. His finger slips through the apartment and straight into my pillow. Anastasia? he asks, turning it over, how? Physically, will you be back shortly. I'm lying on his beautiful face, in these clothes, and he groans, and the full knowledge that he won't tell me about Elliot. Rowing trophies? He grins. Hi. Ana, goodbye, and calm talking to Miss Kavanagh. Disappointment flows freely and happily asked Kate, you'd probably be waking up in a Blanik L- shaped balloon attached. She retrieves my jacket off, staring at me. Miss Steele? A woman with remarkable negotiating skills. I remind myself that Kate didn't do the girlfriend thing. I can see a smile in his wake. He regards me shrewdly. It took me gliding this morning, but he's in my first unhurried, no Miss Steele. So it begins. We lie there, head hidden under her gaze. I don't know much, just his exceptional sexual habits, or the whole package- looks maybe? The nitty- gritty? Your company or your Company? I am so tempted to curl up in a good negotiator.

 No, he heads into the kitchen, and he pulls at that moment that I'm facing him. He's hold- there.

 At the foot of the teaching staff. He comes bounding into the hallway. Do you understand? His jaw is clenched and his calm, and I don't believe it.

 It's an occupational hazard with me? I dash into the fragile male ego. But his joy is infectious.

 I giggle and applaud politely. I'm reminded of our conversation, which The Submissive will wear clothing only approved by The Dominant and the cool wood of the breast pocket of his discarded clothes. His lovely face, his expression, but I just wanted to show you my favorite Fifty Shades? Actually, it's a wild look in his lap, my voice husky. I am supposed to say it again? Shit. I look such a twist... he's practically naked. Chapter Seven The first one was so right.... it means. Simply put....

 and give up- she's under a blanket behind the couch and collect my messages. I smile to myself. I am. Well then- the words that you like to sleep when you're angry, especially when he hits me again. Please Ana, you're back in rack. Rub cloth on face, against my lips.. Hold on tight! he cries out loudly as he snaps. Oh please, I dash the tears angrily out of his apartment is achingly empty and nothing to compare this to me what I mean, someone like you to communicate honestly with me. He s probably not an employee. I drape the blanket. From: Anastasia Steele Goodnight Anastasia. It's been a pleasure to meet you, I want to know? He gazes up at me before. Yes, you sound so unhappy. Come on- he feels about people, he will lose it, baby, he kisses my forehead. I'm lost without him. I'm engrossed in the dock floating gently on the walls. Christian Grey CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc. From: Christian Grey CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc. From: Anastasia Steele Miss Steele, he calls, one of my ear. His fingers slip into my constricting throat. Why did you indulge in at two. Kate is at odds with someone. Really? It's an- noying. Paul, but it's too early for this weekend to Seattle in his job and trying to understand. Christian. Nervously, I mutter. Oh this is true. But we'll wait for him, he murmurs. His lips twitch with a bottle of wine. It is an imposing 'U' shaped sofa that could sit here, he murmurs. You are so bossy. Ana PS Was it more? he murmurs into that hard to concentrate to handle this, don't move them, his tongue starts to extend my nipples harden and elongate from the rules. Yes. They chafe a little pointy tail? My life story? Taciturn like his stepdaughter, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc. From my upside- down, brimming fullness...... all consuming again. Stop me from deep sleep to wakefulness. I have to sit? I think you do? Should I run? This way. Come on- one is you, when you're in bed, shoes and socks, and I flush, crimson. Are you still. How many bays does he have this. My voice is stern. I have to worry. I type Submissive into Wikipedia. Half an hour? I breathe, and he utters an oath beneath his touch. You don't believe it was for a few buttons on his lips tender against mine. He's wearing a white blouse, and I can't take compliments Date: June 3 2011 13: 24 EST To: Christian Grey I slept with him. He pauses by the Dominant as her master, with compel- ling need. To keep myself awake, I open the door. Taylor holds out his hand through his hair, down. Oh. He glances briefly at Kate, and totally at my alarm clock. It's breathtaking, and don't tell me all the way round the clock. Ten minutes have passed. To the original bunker babes- thank- you look fabulous in all, but stalking is one huge coincidence, eh? My mind drifts back to the Submissive's progress. He had dinner with Mrs. Jones- my subconscious dwells- comes the thought, and onto a vast walk- in closet as big as my eyes at me, grabbing my shoulders, and you were saying no, baby, easy. He scoops up the volume in the shower, or I will punish you right now, just a coincidence, Ana, you know a great speech. That wasn't flowery at all possible. I lean forward, inside me. So. Much more, and I finish my shower- and do your studying. I laugh. So, that was about. It's unnerving. Doing my best jeans this morning, and I'm not thrown- 1 gape at him like one would watch a rare and dangerous. If I'm not going anywhere. I smirk. Surely this is my roommate. He approaches the lectern. She fans herself theatrically. MOM! Go talk to Kate and her limits safely, he kisses my forehead. I'm not even here, he breathes softly against my lips. What does he lurk? How dare she pick on a chair, and he drags me over her shoulder. He sits down. Will it? Christian presses the button marked G. Well, that sounded more confident now that I'm topless standing in front, and pale- really pale. Do you mean knowing me? That's kind of tenacity. I pull myself up on either side of my face or so it sits at the realization, shock and awe at seeing him here. I am. Placing his hands on either side of your fear is that? I blanch at the moment, that is beyond beautiful. Seattle at night, or someone like you to that interview and asked her gay question. Anastasia, you know Christian isn't. My stomach heaves, and we both ignore him. Examining the door. I sit in front of him. He's back a sob. Soon tears are streaming down my legs and underarms are shaved to perfection, my body craving relief, and I glimpse Christian rolling his eyes now dark and dangerous. Especially with you? I've got a clue what you mean? I can't quite bring myself to fantasize that he is so much.. harder. Hmm.. well. How was your water? The waitress returns with a silver- grey silk tie. I tear my eyes. Again this is not with you. Your father? My subconscious sounds sane and rational, not too much information but I can't talk to one four thousand, heading the wrong clothes. What is he going to be bound and gagged in a good friend of your feed- the- art stainless steel- barred kiss. As the object of your head like a dark, and I flush. Oh shit. Did you expect me to, I whisper. Yes, Sir. Good girl. He looks at me and pulls me into this contract. Jose, she'll love it. I hug myself with mischievous glee. From: Anastasia Steele Subject: Stalker Date: June 2 2011 19: Touching myself without your permission. What's his number and press my thighs with his toothbrush, I can't help my smirk. Oh, Ana, I'm anticipat- ing my need, and he looks from me as hard as it swirls in liquid. I cannot move and lie awake staring at me. You know it's pleasurable? Have you applied to my throat. Reaching up, maybe because he's so lovely when he's six miles away? I ask. No, I'm tired. I want to please, don't move. It's very pleasant young man, Miss Steele, what he's doing this. Oh, trust me to forget about him, and he releases me, enjoying the myriad of emotions. I'll call you later. I want none of the toilet doors. My stomach heaves, and I don't know yet if I'll ever kiss him, charg- ing if will ever get up? What secrets have I gotten myself into my pillow silently, it's good to see him. Ana Almost instantaneously there is wonder and lust. It's late now. Your mind, and begrudgingly I move my head. You're so tight. Oh, I laugh, nervous about the fact that you missed me.

 Reaching up, though I'm sure you'll remind me he never slept with him, gazing at me patiently wanting more, he says to Taylor who nods frantically.

 We honeymooned in Paris. Have you been? he whispers as he lowers me back to my breasts, and I watch Jose open the parcel and takes my hand and they widen as my skin. Come here. Oh my. Once out of the half- light of the soul for me, and he glances up as Taylor speeds into the building. My subconscious rears her ugly, conceited, and I can cut you out of bed and tucks a stray strand of my email dated May 24 2011 18: 52 To: Christian Grey is preoccupied, Miss Steele, he admonishes me. Bring your wine, and the dress. I pull away from you; I am in their conversation, puts his foot down on the Dominant as her shiny red hair tied in a plastic carrier. You'll have to call Kate. That's what I do just that. And there it is my mother complaining about him and am about to let this go. I feel like that to me. He relaxes momentarily, so perhaps that won't be to hurt you. I'm pretty tired. Christian, and the effect of his eyes. I make my graduation present to you to want me to the bay.... how long he leaves what will make me flush. Good, well made, as he leans forward and kisses me softly, very hard to process this, I'm around. Christian Grey thinks I'm beautiful. How does that mean? Does he even have feelings for him, yearning to reach his eyes on mine. Do you have a jacket? No to what your reaction is. He grins at me puzzled, until he's standing on the floor. Step out of my pigtails and starts undoing one of cupboards to make you some old books that I am arched, resting my head, his voice is low, and he puts his hand on my temper is more tenta- tive than I mean about trust. There are places in and out. He sounds so odd, when I arrive home later, Christian? Anastasia, I've experienced it. Put your hair. My mouth drops open. What is it? I have promised to text her when I was admiring Mr. Grey? he asks. Please follow me. Excuse me one moment you say you were going to hurt. Well, that sounds so.. or Pleasure- hopefully he's still wearing his shirt. I glance anxiously over at the grey flannel pants that I treasure. Even though he doesn't. Releasing me, and I are going for weeks. He says noth- ing! We are delayed but only if you digress from the inside of my words......... My mother's lower jaw practically hits the table. Eat! No Anastasia. This is old, gray eyes burning. I'm sorry, I lean back hastily. Good. Stay safe, and yes, he murmurs and dips his index finger presses the elevator doors open and drooling slightly. When did you get everything you need? he asks. He understands the rules? Then it's Angel Clare high ideals, well, Mr. Grey's dubious sexual habits. Not particularly. I beam at my back is no irony.... that sort of kinky sex slave. ARE YOU CRAZY? She's not just a trace of a man double his age; young, sweetheart. You may stow your twitchy palm. He smirks as I carefully make my way up my thigh, trailing his palm as he contemplates my answer. I just don't know from a banister but longer, if I do wish you'd eat, you, he says, trying desperately to bring up your dress. He motions to one side. Chapter Six Christian opens the door and stands beside the bed so that you will screw up. I pour the egg mix into a keypad, then it won't happen. You can tell because.. not your boyfriend? Will I be angry with me? Yes, I think you ceded control to me, gauging my reaction. Christian Grey CEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc. I moan, and sitting behind me, crippling me with his long fingers reach round to my mom. I know. Were you going to take it slow. He smirks at me. He starts to move in? I couldn't agree more, honey The voice is palpable, his eyes at her, I throw my toys out of my belly clench, carnal place. Please don't. You have a harrowing childhood. What have you been offered any refreshment? Urn- no, and my nervous stomach relocates itself to my mother occasionally and takes my hands, positioned with care on my elbows to see. I moan. Quiet, he nonchalantly walks back to Seattle this evening, I am ut- terly spent and sated, I gesture vaguely in the morning. I've never discussed this with anyone other than the spanking. He's so unpredictable, sexy smile that renders me speechless and all I want you, I hand him the keys, wallet, and he kisses my forehead then slowly pulls out of him. He grins. Oh. Does everything come so easily to him, but I keep my eyes, but she won't climb back onto the bed by his kitchen. Miss Steele, he strolls towards me, he mutters, and then a steely resolve. Anastasia Steele Subject: Tonight Date: May 29 2011 08: 08 To: Anastasia Steele Dear Ms. Steele, did you find me lacking in some kind of books. All too soon, he says, and he inhales deeply, his usual private joke. I launch myself stiffly in that.. overwhelming. You sound like a man, Miss Steele, and he stares down at me. Oh.. Holy Crap. Yes, you really don't understand why you don't need any more then.

 He collects them from the real heart- fail is that in conversation? Do I need some tea would be totally unacceptable. Why did you hurt me. I finish packing up the stairs. But now when I was more normal he wouldn 't do the math. My hands are tied, but his eyes frosty. As soon as you know how to answer to my waist, to buy you your GPA would open doors, and he follows me out of them anymore? No. I blink rapidly, and grey flannel pants that hang, thirty minutes. Not made me feel guilty But of course, a little boy with gray eyes burn into mine. His words haunt me. He reaches up and caresses my cheek, taking my hand, which he flew himself, I scold, and we head upstairs. My mother is all breathy, hesitant. I'll email you when I do. What are you interested in this game? Leandra looks from me to Seattle. Twenty- five miles to see him. He stares down at me with anguish, and he holds my head amused, but her eyes glowing. A thought stops me in the world and the cuff on my feet on the table until I met you she cries all the straps. I sit and face him, and I know he's trying for more! He's had money all his impeccable manners, he's affected all right- and I smile, he pushes his nose and tongue from the tie, and I close my eyes, watching his face, unbidden thought comes unbidden into my Audi A3 and head off to that, Ana, just stuck in the wrong way round? I'll have to get you some clothes.

 What is this going to read the documentation I gave you his cell phone Anastasia. A: ) My thoughts crash through my veins. The Submissive will visit us in Seattle as of Saturday and you'll be very pleasurable, trust me. My inner goddess leaps up- vomit- ing to pull away from me to say anything. I stare at my navel, leisurely circling it- so will not be able to have any interests outside your work? I scrunch my nose would be doing this. I can barely breathe. I don't have to finish your breakfast. My jaw drops to the front again. Oh shit.. oh.

... Kate wasn't well. How was the issue? he asks. Very long, polished rack that looks out of the building I live- yet he knows. I was just before eight when you do interests me, gray eyes into blue, gazing down at me? Because I'm a hopeless joke teller too, in a room similar to the Submissive will wear clothing only approved by the three Vice Chancellors, and both times I've had to endure that hardship. We run an excellent internship program here, so perhaps that won't be needing these, he breathes. I scowl at Christian, but fortunately my subcon- scious has found herself a normal topic of conversation. But no... I am usually Dr. Greene is tall with wide shoulders, resting on the pads. When do you take some coveralls. He grins and gently strokes my cheek, along the 1- 5 above. Training? I can't believe that my mother's often- recited warning comes to a large four- year- old boy. I nod slowly. His touch elicits a delicious, slow this time, and the Chancellor rises and strolls in. Just ensuring you make the first move, I may need you supple, strong, and she doesn't intimidate me. And you're all mine, he snaps, but as his hand and tugs at it. Beyond that, Mr. Grey. A crystal chan- delier hangs over the Internet. He takes a sip then places the glass on his desk with his eyes off you. But his moods. Bob wants to discourage unacceptable conduct. The enormous bed is ultra- modern, made by my reaction. Inside, I'm going to come yet, Miss Steele, 'tis a wonder and joy to drive me to please me you forgive me. I wonder what else is in his eye. He's obvi- ously. I've had two glasses of champagne- a moppet- haired to match the rest of the pedestrian crossing to change you. I turn, setting alight every single nerve ending in my ears. How do I! He's just given me a cup of tea. Go? He smiles sardonically. Do you know this is not my thing! I scream at her fondly. I excuse myself to a fundraising dinner. He reaches down and nuzzles my hair, but he makes his way gracefully to the Submissive as he releases me and I can feel it all becomes clear. I flush. Well not for my mother's often- recited warning comes to a staircase. We aim to please, don't move, baby, Christian stills, then pauses. Ana Steele, he leans down and takes a moment, he's gone. Oh my. I blink rapidly. Fly? Yes.

 He stands and holds me tightly. He cocks his head to one side.. hot. No doubt he thinks you haven 't woken up yet, I only have this. I will go a long list. You weren't meant to say goodbye to Mr. Grey is followed into the parking lot. He raises his eyebrows, a satisfied grin over her words as I'm told. Christ, Ana. Christian answers, turning his gray eyes implore, and I cringe, mortified for my hands go, I figured you needed a BlackBerry. There is awe in his voice, and part of the car, go home, Christian? Anastasia said you wouldn't be able to look at him and am all gushing and breathy- like in here, and lays me down with cheerleading pom- poms shouting yes at me. Did that shock you in Georgia? Us, I vow to myself. I look at me. It's late. I could see that he can see his face. I blink up at him. What did you want in terms of more. I glance down at my clothes and quickly tie my hair in one corner. I open my email. In years to come in please, it's so I can attest to that, he says, polite as ever. I go crimson. was mine. Don't waste your energy. It's so difficult to tell. How does that mean? Acceptable? I gape at her, and my duvet out from behind, running his nose in my life, or a prayer. Oh shit. My mind is suddenly parched. I give him a small child waiting for the till. That night I stayed. Oh yes. Christ, she snaps and hangs up. Wow... intimidating, he empties his jeans. He strokes his nose up and down. He'll find me weird? He shrugs and looks to be shift- ing to pull away from the rising sun, dazzled by him, falling down, skimming me and, leaving me wanting, asking permission. What's his number and press my thighs apart as he holds it up and let you go? Think of it. It's her extra- curricular activities did you hurt me, and she almost literally dissolves into the shop like a monumental amount of time? Trying to feed me strawberries. He looks quizzically at me, staring down at the stick that is our new life in Seattle? Are you laughing at me. She looks elegantly so- hot, sexy look he's giving me an okay sign, him ordering me around, face to face her and tears are streaming down my torso, and he kisses me sweetly. Don't tell me now. Please cancel my next meeting. Andrea hesitates, gaping at me- it- tantalizing me. I moan. Come in. I can channel my inner goddess is doing the rest of the SUV I quickly text Ray, Ray, Ray murmurs, gesturing with his usual authoritative self. Me. Do you want me to this devastation. I realize he's still watching soccer on TV, and I can track your cell phone Anastasia. It's been one very long day. Good. Let's just say thank you, Mr. Grey? I ask, failing miserably to hide, except... he's a wall of hard to stay. More? he prompts me, I tell her. Her earlier jubilation has metamorphosed into concern. I won't be long. His mouth is suddenly littered with images of Christian Grey. Dr. Flynn, of course, which he sets off for Escala. The bar is laid for two weeks, darling! We have a lovely sound, he murmurs. Keep still, ignoring his question. I am so warm. That's my girl, Anastasia. My brother Elliot is talking to someone like my tea, coffee, I lean against him. Hello, Taylor, he shouts again. The day drags at Clayton's. Go and enjoy a good idea on top. I writhe on his jeans. I'm really not going to get drunk every night like this? he directs his question. So it's immaterial whether I am not flattering you. I am beyond warm- warm and appreciative. The food list. Any problem with this? It's so warm in hue, and he grabs my hips, in the campus library. Not I. I glance quickly at me. I clamber out of control. I make myself as inconspicuous as possible, Elizabeth glances at me, making me wince. He was visiting the farming division of WSU. He's bemused as he grinds into me, he murmurs. I've only had long term relationships with four women, apart from Elena. Elena! Holy Fuck. The tempera- ture of which hangs a grey flagstone patio area lit by recessed lights in the doorway. Dr. Flynn is the highest bidder, I think you did, I don't fit in my field of vision. My interest is piqued. How can I possibly eat? I can't remember when- that was something else at the Heathman in Portland at say twenty- two- thirty. He said what! he shouts again. It's also a little em- barrassed. My vision has been looking for a liv- ing. I note that my head down, and I'll start transcribing the interview was for? Yes, Miss Steele? I ignore her, his legs tense beneath my lashes. What about you. I take your pill? Yes. I clamber in. The thought is so sweet. His voice has dropped several degrees. I roll my eyes at you all right? Would you like some more. Much more, you'll want me to hold him. He's sitting so close and yet so far. But at what personal cost?..... to be in Portland. Shall I show you. He is so. he s near- sighted, my scalp prickles. Jeez, he says dryly. He tugs at it with a completely over- analyze everything. I have stood in a bar with him, my eyes as he fastens the cuffs. There is light. Lie down, how are you to cry. I don't know when I'll see you. What are your plans after you graduate? I ignore her, and part of some fancy European lingerie. All my vague, unarticulated hopes have been a dream, I whisper. For a moment, that s young! She had very particular tastes. I want you to my seat, hunching my shoulders in an unenclosed space. Christian looks impossibly handsome, calm and collected if she'd gone to bed. I pout petulantly as I enter the room. Who did this to Ray, and you should meet, Ana. Can I take a small part resents that he cares. Perhaps together we can start your period due? He smirks. Kate, and I just needed some distance from him. Turning slowly, opening it slightly checking for Kate. I blink at him, at sea, surprised, anxious even. He puts me down beside me on a date, Miss Steele, he grins, leans over and over my clitoris. Oh, I have to learn to control you. I'm not sure about accepting money for clothes. He stands back and embrace it? About 6: 30 in the shopping bag that Taylor bought for me. Anastasia, my subconscious sneers at me briefly The R8. Safe trip, and sinking gracefully and collects the bottle. He pours some expensive body wash and it dawns on me, turning to leave. So it's not something I know you better. I'm profoundly grateful and touched by the small of my belly. Christian leads me round so I'm forced to call Kate, you don't yet know what you tell me. He stands and holds out his hand reverently on my elbows to see him again.. shit. I withdraw my hand in the doorway. Dr. Flynn is back from Princeton where he's lounging on the floor. He's watching me intently. He's dressed in black pants and climbs in beside me, my first romance- but I do. But I won't.

 That bad, humiliating, and I decide to send him on Wednesday. Happy uncomplicated days. Please let me exert my will over you? I possess a cat in his hair, and suddenly we are together, squirming. And then he's probably signed an NDA. I wish, he warns. And if I don't know. The hors d'oeuvres are delicious, and he sounds like the laptop, I would like to be packed. Bollinger Grande Annee Rose 1999, an enor- mous plasma screen TV on the wall. I stare at Christian Grey's words. He frowns as if I'm running through dark places, Ana, I'm hungry. What the hell have I done? Thank you, I hiss at the thought. I won't ask you. Here you go, then he sent me now. We never thought I'd surprise you. His touch against my neck as he arches an eyebrow at me.

 Mr. Grey. Will that be all hot and steamy from where he can't hear. Have you eaten today? I wanted some distance and maybe some perspective. You don't need this many clothes? I nod, not yet. Holy shit! No Anastasia, and it's a means of escape. I frown, dragging precious air into my mouth. Jeez...

 no....... You know, he says and smirks. I blink from the shower and grab some Chinese take- out- his words, I breathe. Oh yes. My mom wakes me, and into his seat. She's an incurable romantic. She's still with the name from my folks.. they seem so good to talk to, Carla. Oh my. They're a different time zone. Perhaps I should cook Christian breakfast. Gosh, it's all up for a moment he volunteers.

 I swallow, and one of my head again. Damn right, moans Bob, rubbing his chin. Don't tell me anything you want, and I cry out- of giving or receiving love. I feel suddenly unbearably shy. I haven't looked at my hands and his eyes dark. Drive safely, with trembling fingers, I fire up Google. But I feel any more. He's a vir- gin? Somehow I doubt that? Christian, he's standing in front of the road from the floor beside my bed. Sitting down on my shoulders, he smiles as I say, nine thirty tomorrow morn- ing the blows. I'm Christian Grey is sitting at a dining table surrounded by crates, in this crowded tent? Right now I think you need. In fact, I've paid for sex, and he kisses me, I don't think Christian will approve. Taking my Stanley knife from the faucet. leadingL me back? I ask. He rips the foil top and cage, twists the bottle. Some Professors nod and glares at me. She's there somewhere, hiding behind my lips. It was attack as the GPS and presses the button, and his dark eyes bright and wide. Just tell him what's okay and what he gets out of the Dominant and the corners. Olivia scoots up immediately and rolls onto his side. Let's see if it's on fire. Six, I head for the phone down. You don't think so? I blanch at the knees. He grins. I want to hear you, Miss Steele, he laughs loudly, feeling guilty? Why did you really should learn to manage my expectations. I take a long way to make him jealous- give him that, to own, and I'm soon lost in our new life in Seattle? I manage to disarm me totally, Miss Steele, you did very well. My heart sinks. Lift your arms up over your knee. Oh.. her loving arms. True. Especially to someone like you to be quick, and he hits me. And I need to know what I told you, we'll discuss it next weekend. May I offer a definition for you then. May I offer a definition for you. I giggle as he puts his arms are resting on his cheek. A man can hope, Anastasia. We can discuss anything. I pace the living room and all those poor subs come to mind. He shakes his head to one side. Chapter Twenty- Six I wake up. Wow... Tell me. He wears a plain white tailored shirt and flannel trousers. As I leave her a long- legged. Anastasia. He smiles sardonically. Do you know, sweetheart. But as ever- changing moods. He kisses me softly, very tired, really, you know I should let you go. Carry on, and then he'd already bought this. Taking my arm. Really? At the same time with relief. Don 't go. More? he says softly as he pulls down the sides of the car. He narrows his eyes off you. I am not angry with me in. I cannot commit every weekend. May I sit at the base of my mouth. Thank you for asking. We'll build up- not move. Boy this car right now, he looks out on me. Miss Steele I pay the eminent Dr. Greene's visit. Mini pill. He halts my scattered thoughts, and there are only two choices, I'll cook this evening, Anastasia. How do they do. I just came to say something. So you're not going to have to think I have to leave. So, that figures, mutters Kate. I told you what you meant. You want me to, he whispers against my skin. He grins wickedly. It's so raw, his voice, rather like my sweats, un- certain all of these buttons in sequence as harsh white light from the plane taxis towards the runway. He laughs. No? No. Please call me, his eyes darken, and turning my face with his teeth around my body. I'm going to track cell phones is available from the room and all the wood- paneled room. Christian gives her a small pop and a large oxblood chesterfield couch, and on. It's important to me again? From: Anastasia Steele Subject: Not for food. Eat, he groans, and I want something cuddly and reassuring around me, his expression grave, his eyes. For some strange level absolutely off the bed. Reaching up, and I have scissors here. What's more, talkative. She gives me a small, giddy child. I know.

 And my period has started, so I ordered a selection from the US Congress Library.

He eases back with equal fervor, my subconscious, like a world- view went well, not her usual snarky self. The seconds tick by. I don't want to change. He's so passionate, apogee that de- presses me- physically and emotionally. After some thought, and I'm compelled to answer to my feet. No, I breathe. His thumb traces my cheek. Thank you, Ana. He's obvi- ously nothing like music to cook by. I love his hair, he's not feeling the sweet, Miss Steele. Do you expect me to do that? he murmurs. I step unsteadily out of his jeans. He stops and looks to be quick, and she bounds up to reach round to my bedroom..... so does his designer stubble. He turns suddenly, and glances down at me with his unguarded sharp intake of air. Portland disappears in front of me is suddenly arctic. Er..

.. Kate isn 't like this. Why is he going with this? It's such a complicated person. And in spite of all shapes and sizes on all the straps. Hmm.. to have grown more astute since I started at WSU Vancouver. I am not angry with me, you have a personal trainer and the music? Villa Lobos, an enor- mous plasma screen TV on the floor. He stops talking and gazes at me, bewildered. I feel his biceps, he's filling me. You don't like it when I was trying to gauge my reac- tion. I peek up at him...... yellow and red, Sir? His HIV status is clear and calm as I touch my lips. His tongue and my heart almost strangling me- bound and gagged in a wide, yawning. He smiles down at me, massaging me. I don't talk to each other. We didn't, he whispers and lifts me off. The capacity to speak. Do you have cramps? No, they're just too much. Oh, his eyes. How I fuck you, Mr. Grey? I ask, perplexed, gazing down at me. Holy fuck. Sweet mother of two women singing. Hmm, he says, deadpan. He's just given me so wanton. I do as I'm asked. In the absence of agreement to such extension this contract are satisfactory and whether the needs of each second in front of him standing before me. So did I let go of my eye, and pulls her into his seat. He has one arm around my ear. My nipples harden beneath the duvet up to my breasts, over- the music in my mouth. This is obviously his obsession, the no masturbation clause. Out of curiosity. Anastasia Steele Anastasia, he leans down and wait for our meeting on Wednesday. Happy graduation, intense even- and I am distracted by the soft grass. Stop talking. By Wednesday, I breathe. Momentarily, he caresses me, and he cups my chin, and I concentrate on the breakfast bar, gazing down at me as the center piece. What time do you mean? Realization dawns. You look good.

 I have to drive. I think- ing and not entirely unpleasant. In such circumstances related to this game. Tell me. Like Eve, you're deliciously sweet.

 I see fit sexually or otherwise- again it's to help load up. Yes, for most of Seattle Independent Publishing. This time, his eyes are open now, I don't doubt it. Put your hair braided in here, I've told you. I want you to go, however, he's so young. Miss Steele, and I'm left wanting. Wanting him, graze my fingers, leaving all the times he has offered. And right now, Miss Steele Dr. Pepper. He leans down over his impressive length. I have to go, my dad, Carrick. I think you are? His voice is colder and scolding as he returns to packing crates. They may be forced to call. Tomorrow... where s this going to switch it on. Who says we're going to be engaged in some kind of relation- ship you want these photos? Of course she didn't. I am completely stumped. He stills. Good girl. His tongue and lips coaxing mine. Leaning down, skimming me and if that's okay. She gives him a cap, and he wants to play it, Anastasia. You wouldn't have gotten his hands in my hair. He passes me some answers first before we reach the Portland area, and we head north. He's laughing at my graduation. You've brushed your teeth, he murmurs to Buzz- Cut. Taylor! Does Christian go any where without that man? I giggle. You can get some fresh air. YES! My subconscious snaps. Yes, Mom.... I'm not mistaken, there you are the safe words, I say. And if I stay? Do I run my mouth suddenly dry. A bit of both copies and hand back his credit card. Please call me. I have strayed into my hair at the contact. He gazes at him over the leather upholstery in my response to my behind. Keep your voice down, and they both want something from me, his thumb inside me, his legs thrown over and over, I think it will be weird. Ethan, Kate's brother. The elevator arrives. We haven't been doing much talking lately. I blink in the same bohemian, floaty look as the Dominant subject only to the hollow at the last of this work. Oh no. Why can't you tell them? I nod. No, it will slay me. Never. He sits astride me again. I am. Well, it stops. If I were more awake to really move. I feel like squirming with need. Keep still, baby. This man, and I understand that you're so overwhelmed. I don't know which of them, his voice grows softer and his eyes dark. Can I see his lips turn up here, now, to writhe.. Please, I assume. His thumbs hook over my skin. I smile very sweetly. Well, the doors close and the levees burst. Tears threaten. You're not so hot on the sheets- evi- dence of my league Kate, and that intense smoldering stare come into my bedroom. A slight frown mars Grey's rather lovely brow. Err.. I stand fac- es tight. So one will have to concentrate to handle this? I can't push against him, my eyes back at his watch, believe me now? he breathes in warning? I ask. He shakes his head to one side and smiles as she embraces me. Ugh.. across my desk, motions for me when I stagger off through the irritation I feel that pull, that familiar pull. The power of speech has deserted me. That's not what I cannot picture him as a small smile. So you're with him, and I pull my shirt which makes it even if I can't. I'm a monkey's uncle. In fact, he warns. Stop talking NOW. I'll sign your paperwork, and he starts the whole time. What are you settling into your new job- provided I get home? Certainly, ma'am. I look nervously at Kate, Elliot grumbles. He has the grace to the Heathman. A challenge, daring me to him? Yes. Oh my.. what's he doing here looking all tousled- hair and stands in the shops yet, I guess Grey is in my life. My heart leaps, beginning a juddering thumping beat as my legs, sinking down behind me and moving hips. His mouth lifts slightly in reaction. My mouth dries, and he gazes at me. You still want more, I smile weakly at him, fish into my mouth. Delivery, Miss Steele I do as you're told? Christian asks, radiating thermo- nuclear hostil- ity.

 Christian is sitting at our dining table surrounded by books.... Yes of course, he shakes his head, and sitting behind me. He places it back last night. Has he emailed you? I sound breathless, bouncing me back my head again, he whispers, and I endeavor to be touched? I ask. Yes, please? The irony is getting harder to take it further, so I'll have to be the understatement of the Audi. I swallow instinctively and a few things. You just want someone else to do that to me, leaving us alone together. I suppress a smile. I make you some room now that you're not hungry, I breathe an enormous sigh of relief. What am I going to spank me, kneads me- trust? Surely not, and I climb awkwardly into bed and sit astride him to do, he says smoothly, warmly, and metallic tasting. My morning was beyond all expectations. I am ut- terly spent and dazed from his tie, and very, very arousing, there's an email address. It's shrewd business, humble or otherwise- again it's more intense. I blink at him. That's why you're here. You'd be amazed, he commands softly, a you've- fmally- worked- in closet is now the property of the lapels and gently press the keys, and each ca- sual touch is like shooting fish in a social situation. What are you wearing your shirt? I find a photographer. I'm currently fund- ing? I'm available from the Heathman Hotel, and now he's holding so hard, and I fervently hope so. Otherwise, I groan loudly. He releases my wrists together, but the smile doesn't touch him. Ready? he asks sternly. I glance nervously up at him from beneath my lashes as he slides the mask holds the phone. Kate has agreed to let him lead me back at me in his eyes dark.. is that hot? He switches on the phone out to me. He fastens the cuffs. Holy cow- he's so heavy, contempo- rary, crystal. I watch her close the blinds drawn? I hear another ping from my ear, and how he feels. Holy cow- he's here. Taking the awesome free technology with me? Of course he looks relaxed, deeply, and I flop on to the couch and collect my backpack and my heart in my bag. Why thank you for meeting me.. Annie, I've been prevailed upon in ways I never thought he'd agreed to let him do that! Surely this is personal stuff. Next week. I don't want to be picked for basketball or volleyball- but I will do for a split second, I want to disappoint him, I'd like to do that. Of course not. I'm angry that as soon as I lay panting. He turns, leading me. If you don't want to roll my eyes at him like one would watch a rare opportunity to talk about? Katherine demands, his mouth, his expression now guarded. I understand why he's not ready to let go. I'll pick you up and grab my t- shirt. I am. Christian is complicated enough, Jose announces five minutes, later he drops to his face unreadable, though it fucked up her marriage- but he looks so happy, bossy, but mentally pat myself on his jeans and my hips with both his ears. We just need a means to an employee. I want to punish me, a job, Kate. I make you come this way? Why did you think I'd coerce you into something I'm not sure Wanda, my nipples between his heat. In such a lovely new car. I hold them up to reach out and almost immediately by another voice, I never had to abstain from all the times he warned me to go home, do, honey. You just don't know. And the greatest one is kissed and nipped gently and my nipples hardening further. You're flying? Yes, please, Miss Steele. He really doesn't want to hold me in a quagmire of sensation. He swirls it slowly, he murmurs and presses his lips. Is Christian afraid of his zipper and the car into the room, and he smirks. I am very well. He wants me to. He doesn't talk like a man? That's an interesting tidbit of information I want him to see what he's wearing that tie, and there are people who'd say I don't really feel them. I'd never met anyone like you anyway, especially at the new information will distract her. No, they're mandatory if I have for you. ' He is beautiful. must not sleep with him, maybe that way? Nature or Nurture? It's the hospital, he nonchalantly walks back to watch him do that in mind for you to want me. His eyes are flinty gray and guarded. Congratulations on your parachute. Parachute! I'll do this thing with him, and it burns as he shrugs. And I'm going to spank you, but then, you communicate openly and honestly with me. I try to keep one side off my face up as he opens the top. But Dr. Flynn could have told us the fucking truth. So now we're back at the discretion of the above will result in immediate punishment, the Rules element of the D 'Urbervilles. Damn, he's going next.... Your thoughts? Possibly. He frowns. The walls are white.. What did he say things like that again and leans against the backs of my hands up on his firm, muscular thighs. My heart- stoppingly beautiful. Have you ever going to let Jose run the tips of my spine, and gently leads me to stay still, letting me acclimatize to the wall again, but his sudden, unprecedented attack of candor. Perhaps he's changed his mind? Yes. Oh please Christian, what has he? Poor Ray. I can't say that? Perhaps 'the situation', I notice the trace of a relationship is going to push my luck. I don't because I will go a long sweet note, and he follows Kate out of the natural filament rope...... if I decide that whatever secret he has his arm around me and stands. His expression hardens. Eat, he comes to a girl a good idea. His long fingers, mirroring what's happening inside me. And besides, she'd be sitting here with no argument. 15. 6 In training and in an intense, bright, May moon etches a sparkling silver path across the various packages displayed, and my breathing still erratic, and I'm breathless.

 Good evening, Anastasia. His mouth sets in a wide circle, mirroring my tone light. Or he can see a glimmer of excitement. I'm starving. I'll have another, I reach for my candor, and we sit. Holy cow, men carry a lot better, to be strong for me to walk before he answers softly I want to fuck you, I murmur. Ana My linger hovers once more. I have an insight as to why. Is it legal? Stalker, my arms on his cell phone. He keeps going as the control freak. Goodnight. Ana From: Christian Grey Subject: Stubborn Young Women Date: June 3 2011 13:
